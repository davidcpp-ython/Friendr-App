# Lenovo Friendr

Lenovo Friendr is a web application designed as a social media app for users to see posts and interact by adding, deleting and even liking posts, and also creating your own user-profile! Built with JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, and Angular.

> This project was realized for the purpose of learning more about backend, and also diving myself for the first time in the frontend part of an app!
> This project was done during the Lenovo Summer School program. It is currently a work in progress, and there is more to come!
